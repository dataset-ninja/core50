**CORE50: Continuous Object Recognition Dataset** is a dataset for object detection, identification, monocular depth estimation, semi supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and classification tasks. It is used in the robotics industry. 

The dataset consists of 329738 images with 329737 labeled objects belonging to 10 different classes including *glass*, *can*, *marker*, and other: *cup*, *ball*, *scissor*, *plug adapter*, *mobile phone*, *light bulb*, and *remote control*.

Images in the CORE50 dataset have bounding box annotations. There is 1 unlabeled image (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (239838 images) and *test* (89900 images). Additionally, every image marked with its ***session***, ***im id*** and ***object id*** tags. The dataset was released in 2017 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">University of Bologna, Italy</span>.
